        I write this site cause that i have some songs that i love to listen
        again, but i live in hell Iran which internet is too much slow and
        censored by governshit! so i have my songs offline(spotify have this
        feature? yes but hell i should by its account which is expensive to
        iraninans) so far so good, then i need my song everywherek, at home and
        work, but it was the time that i realize that my phone have not enough
        space to carry that much song. when i was thinking about how to code
        this, i thouth that how can i make it severless and free at least!? i
        used github pages to deploy this code which wroted with VueJs, and i put
        the songs at github repos too!

        If you wonder how to put your songs here, i shoud say that is too easy,
        just fork this
        <a href="https://github.com/js-radio/station_schema">repo</a>
        then put your songs in
        <code>files/musics/</code>
        then just leave a issue
        <a href="https://github.com/shabane/radio/">here</a>. just with this
        steps you have your own station :)
